![Es gibt ein Bild von Klee, das Angelus Novus hei√üt. Ein Engel ist darauf dargestellt, der aussieht, als w√§re er im Begriff, sich von etwas zu entfernen, worauf er starrt. Seine Augen sind aufgerissen, sein Mund steht offen und seine Fl√ºgel sind ausgespannt. Der Engel der Geschichte mu√ü so aussehen. Er hat das Antlitz der Vergangenheit zugewendet. Wo eine Kette von Begebenheiten vor uns erscheint, da sieht er eine einzige Katastrophe, die unabl√§ssig Tr√ºmmer auf Tr√ºmmer h√§uft und sie ihm vor die F√º√üe schleudert. Er m√∂chte wohl verweilen, die Toten wecken und das Zerschlagene zusammenf√ºgen. Aber ein Sturm weht vom Paradiese her, der sich in seinen Fl√ºgeln verfangen hat und so stark ist, da√ü der Engel sie nicht mehr schlie√üen kann. Dieser Sturm treibt ihn unaufhaltsam in die Zukunft, der er den R√ºcken kehrt, w√§hrend der Tr√ºmmerhaufen vor ihm zum Himmel w√§chst. Das, was wir den Fortschritt nennen, ist dieser Sturm. (Walter Benjamin: √úber den Begriff der Geschichte (1940) )](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Klee-angelus-novus.jpg)

Walter Benjamin famously argued that **fascism is not an independent force but rather a symptom of a failed revolution**. In his *Theses on the Philosophy of History* (1940), he suggested that when progressive movements fail to enact systemic change, reactionary forces step in to preserve the status quo.

Today, authoritarian and far-right movements are resurging in the U.S. and Europe. By applying Benjamin‚Äôs framework, we can better understand this phenomenon as a reaction to the failures of progressive politics, economic crises, and the inability of democratic institutions to address deep societal inequalities. Strikingly, many who embrace fascist ideologies seem fully aware of their destructive consequences. Yet, rather than uphold an imperfect status quo, they opt for destruction, often at their own peril. This tendency is particularly pronounced among those who are, paradoxically, doing relatively well under the current system. 

Historically, this pattern has emerged before. In the years leading up to the rise of Nazi Germany, many members of the middle and upper classes‚Äîespecially those with relative security‚Äîturned toward fascism despite knowing its violent and destabilizing nature. A similar phenomenon occurred in Mussolini‚Äôs Italy, where intellectuals and business elites embraced fascism, believing it would provide order while simultaneously upending what they saw as a decaying liberal system.

At the same time, a critical mistake made by opponents of fascism is the belief that **presenting factual rebuttals or exposing lies will counter its appeal**. However, history shows that fascism thrives on **narratives, emotions, and grand visions**, not empirical arguments. Efforts to fact-check or expose contradictions often fail because fascist ideology does not rely on truth but on **a compelling story that resonates emotionally with its followers**. This has been evident in contemporary politics, where right-wing movements successfully frame themselves as the defenders of a threatened way of life, regardless of factual inaccuracies.

An additional misconception is the belief that **once in power, fascists can be reasoned with or that their inefficacy will expose them and lead to their downfall**. This is another fallacy of empiricism. **Fascists do not need to be competent to remain in power**‚Äîthey thrive on spectacle, fear, and the continuous redefinition of enemies. Frustration and disillusionment often reinforce, rather than weaken, their grip on society. Failed policies or contradictions do not erode their support because their appeal is not based on rational governance but on the promise of destruction, renewal, and dominance.

## **1. Benjamin‚Äôs Thesis VII: Fascism as the Reaction to Blocked Change**

Benjamin argued that fascism emerges when genuine social progress is prevented. He wrote:

> *‚ÄúEvery rise of fascism bears witness to a failed revolution.‚Äù*

### **Key Points:**
- Societal crises create **two potential paths**: one toward **progressive change** and another toward **reactionary repression**.
- If the **revolutionary path fails**, the ruling class and reactionary forces **use fascism** to maintain control.
- Fascism does not introduce real structural change but instead **reinforces existing power dynamics** under the illusion of national renewal.
- Many individuals, even those in relatively comfortable positions, seem drawn to fascism **not despite its destructiveness, but because of it**, seeing destruction as preferable to a stagnant or flawed status quo.
- Historically, fascist movements have gained traction among people who were materially secure but ideologically discontent, preferring upheaval over continuity.
- **Countering fascism requires not just rational arguments but compelling narratives and alternative visions that inspire mass movements.**
- **Fascists do not need to be competent to remain in power‚Äîspectacle and the perpetuation of crisis sustain them.**

This was **exactly what happened in Germany** after World War I. The failure of the 1918-1919 German Revolution and the inability of social democracy to challenge capitalism allowed fascism to rise as an alternative.

Today, we see echoes of this pattern in the U.S. and Europe.

## **2. The Contemporary Crisis: The Rise of Fascism in the U.S. and Europe**

### **üá∫üá∏ United States: Authoritarian Drift and ‚ÄúProject 2025‚Äù**
In the U.S., there is a significant push toward centralized executive power, particularly through initiatives like **Project 2025**. This conservative policy blueprint, supported by think tanks aligned with the Republican Party, aims to:

‚úÖ **Restructure federal agencies** to align with presidential directives.
‚úÖ **Replace career civil servants** with political loyalists.
‚úÖ **Infuse government policy with conservative ideology**, particularly in areas like education, climate policy, and reproductive rights.

Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a historian specializing in authoritarianism, describes Project 2025 as **"a plan for an authoritarian takeover of the United States."**

### **üá™üá∫ Europe: The Normalization of Far-Right Politics**
In Europe, the situation is **equally alarming**:
- **Germany, France, and Italy** have seen the rise of **far-right parties** like AfD, National Rally, and Brothers of Italy.
- **Traditional conservative parties** are increasingly adopting far-right rhetoric and policies.
- **Anti-immigration laws, nationalism, and anti-LGBTQ+ policies** are being normalized under the guise of "protecting national identity."

A recent report by *The Guardian* highlighted how Europe is experiencing a **"steady erosion of political divisions,"** where the far-right is no longer an outsider movement but a **legitimate political force** shaping mainstream policy.

## **3. Why Is Fascism Rising? Benjamin‚Äôs Framework in Action**

### **A) Economic Inequality and the Failure of Progressive Movements**
- Economic policies have **favored the wealthy** while wages stagnate and social safety nets weaken.
- The working class and lower-middle class feel abandoned by **liberal democracy**, making them vulnerable to **authoritarian populists**.
- This mirrors **Weimar Germany**, where economic hardship and political instability led many to embrace the Nazi Party.
- Even among the **well-off**, there is a sense of dissatisfaction, leading some to **embrace destruction over a flawed but stable system**.
- **Fact-based rebuttals alone cannot defeat fascism; only compelling counter-narratives can.**
- **Believing that fascists will be exposed as ineffective is a dangerous misconception‚Äîchaos and crisis sustain them.**

### **B) Political Paralysis and the Weakening of Institutions**
- **Congress in the U.S. is gridlocked**, unable to pass significant reforms.
- **The European Union struggles to respond** to crises like immigration and economic stagnation.
- As democratic institutions appear **ineffective**, people turn to **"strong leaders"** who promise action‚Äîoften at the cost of democracy.

### **C) The Spectacle of Fascism: Manipulating Media and Public Perception**
- Fascists use media to sustain their movement **regardless of policy success or failure**.
- Failed governance does not necessarily lead to loss of power **when spectacle, fear, and crisis management dominate politics**.

## **5. Conclusion: The Urgency of Now**
Walter Benjamin‚Äôs warnings remain as relevant today as they were in 1940. **Fascism does not emerge in a vacuum**‚Äîit is the result of failed revolutions, economic injustice, and political inaction.

Understanding the present through Benjamin‚Äôs lens gives us **both a warning and a roadmap**: 
- Fascism thrives on **emotion and narrative**.
- Rationality alone will not stop it.
- **Only a compelling counter-vision can defeat it before it becomes fully entrenched.**
- **Expecting fascists to fail or be exposed as frauds is a mistake‚Äîdisillusionment fuels, rather than erodes, their power.**
