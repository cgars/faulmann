Now that I'm departing from Saloodo! after two and a half years as Head of Softwareish things and five years in different positions, I want to reflect on what I consider to be, in an idealistic sense, the most crucial topic that I focused on. Our agile culture.  

 It may not come as a shock that I will approach this in a somewhat scholarly manner, which is consistent with my academic background. So here you have a text that, as usual, turned out to be lengthier than I first anticipated. 


> Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed immaturity. Immaturity is the inability to use one’s understanding without guidance from another. This immaturity is self-imposed when its cause lies not in lack of understanding, but in lack of resolve and courage to use it without guidance from another. Sapere Aude! “Have courage to use your own understanding!” --that is the motto of enlightenment. 

 

## Introduction 

To explore the philosophical foundations of modern management practices, especially Agile methodologies, I think it is valuable albeit a bit far-fetched to examine the Enlightenment period, a time marked by a focus on rationality, individualism, and a skeptical challenge of conventional beliefs. Immanuel Kant, a central figure of this era, championed the ideals of autonomy and the courage to use one's own reason.  Looking back at my time as Tech manager at Saloodo! I want to examine how these philosophical principles can be seen not only as historical artifacts but as dynamically relevant to today’s Agile practices, which emphasize autonomy, bold choices, and responsibility. 

Moreover, I want to briefly explore and compare the Enlightenment ideals proposed by Immanuel Kant with the economic theories of the Freiburg School of liberal thinking and try to connect them with agile ideals. Both philosophical movements, in my view, stress autonomy and rationality, which are essential to comprehend the empowerment and flexibility in Agile practices. 

 

## Historical Context of Enlightenment and Kant's Philosophy 

The Enlightenment, often referred to as the Age of Reason, was a pivotal era that emphasized science, rational thought, and the questioning of established traditions. Immanuel Kant, a profound advocate of Enlightenment ideals, famously promoted the idea of "Sapere aude" or "Dare to know," urging individuals to think for themselves without reliance on external authority. This principle not only challenged societal norms but also laid the groundwork for modern democratic values and practices. 

 

## The Freiburg School of Liberal Thinking 

The Freiburg School, or the ordoliberalism school, developed in the 20th century, proposing a powerful competitive economy governed by a solid legal system to guarantee fair competition. This school of thought emphasizes the need for explicit rules and the avoidance of monopolies, perhaps similar to how Agile frameworks establish clear roles and interactions but give teams the flexibility to choose the way to their goals. 

 

## Development of Agile Practices 

Software development and project management underwent a major change with the emergence of agile methodologies, which were devised in the late 20th century and gained popularity in IT in the early 21st century. Originating from a need to adapt quickly to changing conditions, Agile emphasizes flexibility, continuous improvement, and most notably, the empowerment of team members. Agile practices encourage individuals to take ownership of their work, make decisions boldly, and learn through iterations rather than following a strictly top-down approach. 

 

## Comparison of Enlightenment and Freiburg School Values with Agile Values 

Agile methodologies mirror the Kantian call for autonomy and the Freiburg School's emphasis on structured freedom. In Agile, the methodologies like Scrum or Kanban provide a minimal structure for how teams work. I often see a parallel between this and how the Freiburg School proposes a regulatory framework that balances fairness with personal creativity and competition. Furthermore, just as Kant encouraged individuals to use their reason freely, Agile empowers team members to innovate and make decisions that best meet their project goals. 

 

## Agile vs. Waterfall Methodologies 

Agile methodologies promote flexibility, continuous feedback, and adaptability, aligning well with the Enlightenment’s emphasis on reason and individual autonomy, and the Freiburg School’s advocacy for economic freedom within a structured framework. I have often stressed how this contrast, the Waterfall model, with its rigid, linear stages, that do not accommodate the dynamic decision-making and flexibility advocated by these philosophical schools. Waterfall's systematic and linear method, which undoubtedly has some benefits, can, or perhaps should, be regarded as opposed to the Enlightenment's critique of conventional authority and the Freiburg School's focus on avoiding the accumulation of power (similar to avoiding monopoly practices in economics). 

One cautionary note: “Structured framework” does not mean rigid hierarchies. In fact, rigid hierarchies clash with the very ideas of autonomy and self-organization that are key to Agile's philosophy. Hierarchical structures do, in the long run, stifle the rapid decision-making and flexibility that Agile promotes, thereby hindering the efficiency and creativity that is one benefit from strongly developed agile teams. This is antithetical not only to the Agile ethics but also to the Enlightenment ideals of individual autonomy and rationality, as well as to the Freiburg School's emphasis on the spontaneous order arising from individual freedom. Friedrich Hayek, a proponent of the Freiburg School, claimed that real order is achieved through decentralized choices, obstructed if not prevented by top-down regulation. Hence, in Agile settings, promoting a flat organizational structure where leaders act as enablers (or even observers) and not managers is more consistent with both the philosophical foundations and the practical objectives of Agile practices, fostering a culture of constant improvement and innovation. 

 

## Pitfalls in Agile Practices 

Agile aims to foster adaptability and self-organization, but I have seen over the years that the excessive imposition of safeguarding processes and micromanaging on teams often compromises these goals in reality. This not only leads to decreased efficiency but also detracts from the core Agile values of empowerment and self-organization. Such an approach contradicts both Kant’s call for autonomy and the ordoliberal emphasis on maintaining a balance between freedom and regulation, thereby stifling innovation and creativity. This phenomenon might be reminiscent of a common habit many seem to observe among many of my fellow Germans, where the value of a good cause is often diminished by an excessive reliance on bureaucratic rules, ostensibly for the sake of fairness. This tendency can and does inadvertently undermine the very principles it seeks to uphold. 

## The Role of Deadlines versus Prioritization in Agile 

Given what they mean deadlines may be regarded as the least agile thing possible. In the real world, there are efficient machines, but hardly any complex machine exists where every part works in perfect harmony. Almost all machines are dynamic and therefore can only be predicted with some degree of uncertainty. We have acknowledged this uncertainty already by using the word predict, which has its roots deep in meanings of uncertainty.  Agile teams' welcome uncertainty and treat it as a serious matter; this, rather than despite this, makes them flourish in a more adaptable and livelier environment. Deadlines are a cause of unnecessary stress, leading to rushed decisions and lower quality, which goes against the Agile principle of excellence and continuous improvement. Instead of making things faster or more predictable, they make them slower. Rather than setting deadlines, Agile promotes the proper prioritization of tasks, which allows teams to adapt to changing situations and focus on delivering the most value at any given time (prioritizing things, by the way, is much harder than just assigning a deadline, which might explain why managers, like me, often find it hard to let go of the idea).  

This approach aligns with Immanuel Kant’s emphasis on autonomy and the ability to exercise judgment based on current understanding, rather than adhering strictly to pre-set timelines. It also resonates with the Freiburg School’s concept of a self-regulating system, where the natural order emerges not from rigid control but from allowing the freedom to prioritize based on immediate and contextual needs. In this way, prioritization over deadlines not only enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of Agile teams but also reflects a deeper philosophical commitment to human-centric and responsive processes. 

## Educational Methods in Agile 

Following Kant's advocacy for personal exploration and autonomy, I have over time tried to coach the team members in Agile practices through experiential learning. This method in my opinion aligns perfectly with Agile's iterative processes and its emphasis on continuous improvement and adaptation. By allowing team members to engage directly with Agile practices, they not only learn the methodologies more effectively but also embody the Enlightenment's spirit of inquiry and the Freiburg School’s principle of personal initiative.  

Kant’s idea that enlightenment comes from the courage to use one’s own understanding can be directly applied to learning Agile. Instead of simply instructing team members in the mechanics of Agile practices, encouraging them to "try and see," experiment, and learn from their experiences fosters a deeper understanding and a more genuine adoption of Agile principles. This method not only teaches Agile techniques but also empowers individuals to think critically and independently, mirroring the very goals of Agile methodologies. Or to quote Einstein "Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think."  

## Conclusion 

In embracing Horaz’s "Sapere aude," so poignantly amplified by Kant and by implementing experiential learning when promoting Agile, I tried to do more than teach methodologies; I tried to inspire a culture of continuous personal and professional growth. I dare to hope that this way, the values of the Enlightenment and the Freiburg School have deeply shaped Saloodo!s modern Agile practices, promoting a balanced approach where learning and application are equally important. I wish that you would therefore be able to keep questioning conventional methods and feel inspired to adopt a hands-on, reflective approach to Agile learning and practice. 

Therefore, inspired by Darwin's  “It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change”, I would be very happy if Agile at Saloodo could continue to grow and improve by also acknowledging its relatedness to  older ideals. Therefore, my call to you would be let us follow Kant’s motto of 'Sapere aude'—dare to know—as an invitation to constantly pursue improvement and innovation in Agile practices. This proactive approach may guide you along a way that traces the huge footsteps of Immanuel Kant, leading the team to overcome the proverbial self-imposed immaturity i.e.  self-imposed limitations. By daring to know and to think independently, you can thus unleash the full power of Agile methodologies and foster transformative growth within Saloodo! teams and projects.
